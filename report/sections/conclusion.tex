The nodes were not as evenly distributed as we had hoped but in such a large space with such few nodes, its hard to guarantee even load. As we can see in Table \ref{tab:stddev} the standard deviation for the distributions is decreasing as new nodes are added and therefore the load is balancing.

As was expected, the jumps required were not many. With $\log_2(30) \approx 5$ and few nodes, each containing 40 entries in the finger table we are bound to find one soon.

During this experiment we gained a better understanding of the underlying infrastructure and the challenges they aim to solve.
